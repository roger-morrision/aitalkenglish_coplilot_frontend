- **Text Cleaning**: Removes special tags and normalizes quotes for better speech

### Smart Audio Management
- Only one manual audio plays at a time
- Automatically stops when new audio starts
- Clean text processing for natural speech
- Optimized speech rate (0.5x) for learning

## 🎛️ Audio Settings

### Manual Audio Configuration
```dart
// Speech settings for manual playbook
await _manualTts!.setLanguage('en-US');
await _manualTts!.setSpeechRate(0.5);  // Slower for learning
await _manualTts!.setVolume(0.8);      // Clear volume
await _manualTts!.setPitch(1.0);       // Natural pitch
```
